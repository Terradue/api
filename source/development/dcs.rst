Developer Cloud Sandbox
-----------------------

The Developer Cloud Sandbox PaaS is the environment to integrate scientific applications written in a variety of languages (e.g. Java, C++, IDL, Python, R), then deploy, orchestrate, manage and scale them in a very modular way. The algorithm integration is performed from within a dedicated Virtual Machine, running initially as a simulation environment (sandbox mode) that can readily scale to production (cluster mode). Accessed from a harmonized Shell environment, support tools also facilitate the data access and workflow management tasks.
